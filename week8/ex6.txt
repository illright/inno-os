A page size of 8 KB means that there are 8 * 1024 = 8192 bytes to index
within the page. Taking a binary logarithm of that value yields 13 - the amount
of bits needed to index the entire page. Since the virtual addresses are 16 bits
long, that leaves only 3 bits to index the page table entries. Therefore, there
are 2^3 = 8 pages of virtual memory in that machine.
