A virtual address cannot be used directly as a position in the main memory
since it goes beyond its size. This allows the operating system to handle
many memory-intensive programs, even though the physical memory space is
not enough. A physical address is a position in the memory, accessing by
a physical address guarantees the performance of the main memory as opposed
to the swap.
