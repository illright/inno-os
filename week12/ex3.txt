For a 10MB file:

 * regular copy: 0.202s
 * copy with a 10 times larger buffer: 0.096s
 * copy synced: 28.584s
 * copy with a 10 times larger buffer, synced: 3.128s


For a 10KB file:
 * regular copy: 0.003s
 * copy with a 10 times larger buffer: 0.003s
 * copy synced: 0.030s
 * copy with a 10 times larger buffer, synced: 0.010s


Results:

 - increasing the size of the copied file surely
   results in the increase for execution time
 - increasing the size of the buffer decreases
   execution time due to less I/O calls
 - syncing the copying causes a significant increase
   of execution time due to the overhead of synchronised
   I/O integrity requirements
