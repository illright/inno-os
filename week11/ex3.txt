The first code sample produces "Hello" two times because
the buffer was copied during the fork while the "Hello" string
was in it, and then flushed two times.

The second code sample produces only one "Hello", followed by
two newlines because "Hello" was flushed out of the buffer before
the fork, therefore it didn't make it into both processes, unlike
the newline.
